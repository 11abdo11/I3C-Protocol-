# I3C-Protocol-
Description: Implementing one of Hight Data Rate modes in I3C that is Dual Data Rate (DDR) that effectively doubles the data rate by transmitting and receiving data on both edges high and low .
Project Phases :
- Analyzing 3 MIPI standards :
1- MIPI I3C Basic Specification (Improved Inter Integrated Circuit) Specification Version 1.1.1
2- mipi_I3C-TCRI_specification_v1
In addition to the thesis of 2023 Graduation Project .
- Designing the Controller and the Target's hardware architecture.
- Creating RTL codes for the Controller and the Target .
- The Verification is done on the controller on two levels of abstraction where the system is divided to sub
systems and implemented functional verification on each sub system then Integrating the whole system with
implementing final system verification.
- The Verification methodology was a coverage Driven Verification using Randomization with constraints with
functional coverage , code coverage and Assertions .
- Implementing synthesis with practical constraints which is met successfully all the STA Requirements and
formal verification then floor planning and Placement and rout .
